You got it! Here’s everything mashed into one big `README.md` for your `SocialMediaAppV2`—it’s got the intro, features, tech stack, setup, folder mess, planned features, and learnings all in one scrappy, junior-dev-flavored package. Perfect for your portfolio!

# SocialMediaAppV2

Yo, this is my social media app—built it to mess around with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and figure out full-stack dev. Started with some Indian dude’s tutorial, then went rogue adding my own stuff. It’s got posts, chats, follows, and a sweet real-time vibe with sockets. Still a work in progress, but it’s solid enough to show off what I can do.

## What’s It Got?
- **Posts**: Make ‘em, like ‘em, dislike ‘em, delete ‘em if they’re yours.
- **Chat**: Real-time messaging with WebSockets—hit up your buds.
- **Profiles**: Check out users, follow/unfollow, update your own deets.
- **Auth**: Sign up, log in, JWT tokens keep it secure.
- **Uploads**: Toss pics into posts, served from the backend.
- **Timeline**: See your posts and who you follow’s, sorted fresh to old.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Redux (state’s a beast), Socket.IO-client, some CSS chaos.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose schemas), Socket.IO.
- **Tools**: Multer (file uploads), bcrypt (password hashing), JWT (auth).

## How to Run It
Wanna fire this up? Here’s the deal:

1. **Clone It**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xgriffers/SocialMediaAppV2.git
   cd SocialMediaAppV2
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup** (in `client` or root `src` folder):
   - Install deps:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Start it (runs on `localhost:3000`):
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Backend Setup** (in `backend` or root):
   - Install deps:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Make a `.env` file with:
     ```env
     PORT=5000
     MONGO_DB=mongodb://localhost:27017/socialApp  # or your MongoDB URL
     JWTKEY=someSecretKey  # make it random
     ```
   - Start it (runs on `localhost:5000`):
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. **Socket Setup** (in `socket` or wherever `socket.js` lives):
   - Install deps (if separate):
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Run it (runs on `localhost:8800`):
     ```bash
     node socket.js
     ```

5. **Hit It**: Open `localhost:3000` in your browser—sign up, log in, play around.

**Note**: You’ll need MongoDB running locally (`mongod`) or a cloud URL in `.env`.

## Folder Mess
Yeah, it’s a jungle—I was learning Git and went nuts with `.gitignore`s everywhere. Tons of `index.js` files and `package.json`s cuz I didn’t know better. It works, tho!

- `src/`: Frontend React madness.
- `backend/`: Express server, routes, controllers, models.
- `socket/`: Socket.IO for chat.

## Stuff I Wanna Add
Here’s what I planned but didn’t finish—future me’s problem:
- tweak likes so you can’t like your own post
- make likes and dislikes fight each other (exclusive)
- add comments cuz why not
- add sharing posts (like actually share)
- throw in a settings page
- notifications (ding ding)
- search bar that works
- share where I’m at (location)
- schedule stuff to post later
- tooltips when ya hover
- trends that move (dynamic)
- dark mode plz (half-baked rn)
- delete post (wait, done?)
- find peeps to chat with
- make app not suck on phone (reactive)
- follow buttons for trends
- bio spot on profile (backend’s got it, frontend don’t)
- default profile pics for newbies
- ditch css for tailwind (fancy)

## What I Learned
- MERN stack’s wild—Redux is a trip.
- Sockets are dope for real-time.
- Git’s my friend now (kinda).
- Tutorials are cool, but hacking it yourself rules.

Hit me up on GitHub if you wanna chat about it!

#### Notes
- **One Big Chunk**: Everything’s here—intro, features, tech, setup, mess, plans, and learnings.
- **Portfolio-Ready**: Shows off what it does, how to run it, and your journey—great for hiring folks to see.
- **Your Voice**: Keeps that chill, junior dev vibe you’ve got going.

---

### Next Steps
- **Add It**: Toss this into your repo root as `README.md`.
- **Push It**: If it’s not on GitHub yet:
  ```bash
  git add README.md
  git commit -m "Added dope README for portfolio"
  git push origin main
  ```
- **Test It**: Let’s fire it up:
  1. Add that `.env` (from last message).
  2. Start MongoDB (`mongod`).
  3. Run backend (`npm start` in backend folder).
  4. Run socket (`node socket.js` in socket folder).
  5. Run frontend (`npm start` in client folder).
  6. Hit `localhost:3000`—what breaks? Tell me!
